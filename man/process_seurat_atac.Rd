\title{Process a Seurat object with ATAC data}
\usage{
process_seurat_atac(
  sobject,
  assay = "ATAC",
  verbose = FALSE,
  umap_dims = 2:30,
  resolution = 0.3,
  reduction = "lsi"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sobject}{Seurat object containing ATAC data to be processed.}

\item{assay}{Name of the assay containing the ATAC data. Default is
"ATAC".}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether processing functions should
produce detailed output messages. Default is FALSE.}

\item{umap_dims}{Integer vector specifying which LSI dimensions to use
for UMAP calculation. Default is 2:30 (dimensions 2 through 30).}

\item{resolution}{Numeric value for clustering resolution passed to
FindClusters. Higher values result in more clusters. Default is 0.3.}

\item{reduction}{Character string specifying which dimensionality
reduction to use for clustering and UMAP. Default is "lsi".}
}
\value{
A processed Seurat object with LSI reduction, UMAP coordinates
    (stored as "umap_atac"), and cluster assignments. The original active
    assay is restored after processing.
}
\description{
Performs standard ATAC-seq processing workflow including TF-IDF
normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction using singular
value decomposition (SVD/LSI), clustering, and UMAP generation.
