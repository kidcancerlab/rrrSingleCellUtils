\title{Merge multiple ATAC-seq samples into a single Seurat object}
\usage{
merge_atac(
  peak_beds,
  min_peak_width = 20,
  max_peak_width = 10000,
  frag_paths,
  cell_ids,
  n_regions_simul = 2000,
  threads = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peak_beds}{Character vector of paths to BED files containing peak
regions for each sample.}

\item{min_peak_width}{Minimum width (in base pairs) for peaks to be
included in the analysis. Default is 20.}

\item{max_peak_width}{Maximum width (in base pairs) for peaks to be
included in the analysis. Default is 10000.}

\item{frag_paths}{Character vector of paths to fragment files (one per
sample).}

\item{cell_ids}{Character vector of sample identifiers to prepend to cell
barcodes. Must be in the same order as frag_paths.}

\item{n_regions_simul}{Number of regions to process simultaneously when
building the feature matrix. Default is 2000.}

\item{threads}{Number of threads to use for parallel processing. Default
is 1.}
}
\value{
A Seurat object with a merged ATAC assay containing data from all
    samples.
}
\description{
Reads peak BED files, reduces overlapping peaks, and creates a merged
Seurat object with ATAC-seq data from multiple samples.
