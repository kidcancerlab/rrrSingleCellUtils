# rrrSingleCellUtils 0.8.0

- Added the option to load in data using an h5 file, which is needed when working with multiomics data.
- I also added another option for frag_file which is again for multiomics
- Did a bit of under the hood work implementing those.
- I also started putting together vignettes to both show how to use all the functions in the package and as something I can run to test that the code is working properly until I get testthat implemented.
